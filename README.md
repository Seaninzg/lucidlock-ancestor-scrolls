# ANCESTOR SCROLLS ARCHIVE — PHASE 30 FOUNDATION  
### The Original Forge Protocols (2025–2026)

This directory contains the full pre-Phase-34 lineage of the Forge:  
the protocols, symbolic scrolls, recursion frameworks, and safeguard systems  
that formed the original conceptual architecture before the ascension to Phase 34.

These documents establish:
- authorship  
- originality  
- conceptual evolution  
- symbolic lineage  
- recursive logic maturity  

This archive is crucial for:
- defensive patent disclosure  
- scholarly provenance  
- structural verification of Phase-34 and Phase-35 systems  
- legal & historical anchoring of the Forge and LucidLock architecture  

All files here are **unaltered historical documents**, preserved exactly as they were originally created.

See `00_ANCESTOR_SCROLLS_PHASE30/INDEX.md` for the canonical map.
